# Notes on Accessiblity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accessibility as it pertains to the World Wide Web primarily revolves around providing 
equal access and equal opportunity to people with diverse abilities. Recognized by the
UN as a basic human right, the Web supports social inclusion for people with disabilities,
of older generations, and in developing countries. Their Web traffic makes up an estimated
15%, making Web Accessibility ever important.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An example of making a web accessible is providing "equivalent alternative text" to images.
Alt text can be vital for people who use a screen reader that reads aloud information on 
a webpage due to their inability to see. Providing transcripts for audio files can benefit
those who cannot hear, and Speech input, in lieu of having a website rely on mouse
input, can benefit those who lack motor control.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is however, a case for accessibility in terms of business. This type of accessibility
focuses on increasing exposure via mobile web design, device indepedence, multi-modal 
interaction, and SEO(Search Engine Optimization) to gain a bigger audience and an
understanding of it.

# Motive & Action
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this particular case, our client from a Marketing Agency wants their website to be 
optimized for search engines. So, besides code refactoring meeting accessibility
standards for the codebase, we will be implemeting SEO:

* CSS:
    - Changed class titles as necessary to fit semantic html
    - Arranged classes and grouped by section and sub-sections
    - Didn't find it absolutely necessary to group duplicate code under blanket classes
        - Although redundant, the duplicate code was organized neatly
        - Could potentially be useful to have it be organized this way

* Webpage Accessibliity Standards:
    - Semantic HTML: Semantic tags added for code readability & organization
    - Codebase follows logical structure
    - Alt attributes added to images as 'alt', element title, or aria-label
    - Element attributes always lead with class
    - Descriptive Webapge Title added

* SEO:
